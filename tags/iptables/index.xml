      <description>Recently we had a server that needed to be decommissioned and it was one of those old servers everyone has (and always trying to get rid of) that runs too many important things. We knew what processes were running sure, but wanted to be sure nothing was still connecting to it over a long period of time (say, a week). Trusty netfilter to the rescue.
ipsets have many different set types, in this case we used a hash:ip,port type.</description>
